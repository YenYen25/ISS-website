                <p>A nanotechnologist is a scientist or engineer who works with materials and devices on an extremely small scale, typically at the level of atoms and molecules (nanometers, which are one billionth of a meter). Their work involves manipulating matter at the nanoscale to create new materials, devices, and technologies with unique properties and functions. Nanotechnologists can specialize in various areas, including nanomaterials, nanomedicine, nanosensors, nanofabrication, and nanoelectronics. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the job outlook for nanotechnologists is expected to increase by 10% from 2021 to 2031.  </p>
